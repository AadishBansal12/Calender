# 3D Calendar Project

This is a simple web-based 3D calendar project created using HTML and CSS. It features a 3D effect with a slight hover movement to give the calendar a dynamic appearance.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the calendar structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the calendar.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file (currently empty, but can be used to add interactivity).

## Usage

To view the calendar, open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Customization

You can customize the calendar appearance by modifying the CSS in the `style.css` file. Adjust colors, fonts, and other styles to match your preferences.
